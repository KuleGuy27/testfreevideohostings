Test HTML page for embedding free video hosting services links and playing back the videos.
I used Abyss.to for 2 years but because of the slow speeds that I've been getting, I started searching for alternatives.
I also didn't want to use YouTube to host my video embeds because I don't like the interface, it's too mainstream, and it's not a proper backup for my videos.

I found and tested 6 free unlimited storage/bandwidth services, (Vidoza actually has a limit of 1.5TB :(), and these are the ones in the page:

Abyss - https://abyss.to/<br/>
Streamtape - https://streamtape.com/<br/>
Doodstream - https://doodstream.com/<br/>
MixDrop - https://mixdrop.ag/<br/>
Vidoza - https://vidoza.net/<br/>
Lulustream - https://lulustream.com/
