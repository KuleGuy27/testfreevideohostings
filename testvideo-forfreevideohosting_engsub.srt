1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,819
What’s up.

2
00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:03,145
I’m gonna be using this as a test for uploading

3
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:07,079
and streaming video on 5 different free video hosting services.

4
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:08,542
When I first started this website,

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,872
I was thinking about how I would implement videos for my YouTube channels archive.

6
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:13,962
Now for me,

7
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:15,332
the answer was pretty simple.

8
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,185
A few years ago,

9
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:19,380
I stumbled upon a service called Abyss.to

10
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:22,460
and I found it on a Vietnamese anime dub piracy website

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,040
because I wanted to watch One Piece in Vietnamese dub.

12
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:29,283
The One Piece!

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,585
Truly always exist!

14
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:38,576
Abyss is a free video hoster with unlimited bandwidth and storage

15
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:42,354
and I've been using it since 2023 for another website

16
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:44,354
and the creation of this website here.

17
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:47,511
Abyss.to is great but my main problem with it

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,957
is the slow speeds that I've been getting.

19
00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:51,823
It’s a total dealbreaker and even more

20
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:54,897
if you don’t have an adblock to block all the ads.

21
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:55,910
So because of this,

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,731
I went out of my way to “research” alternatives using AI LLMs

23
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,489
and these are the ones that I’ve found.

24
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:03,634
All 5 of them.

25
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,900
I have never used these services before,

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,213
so I am using this video as an opportunity to test and see if they work or not.

27
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:13,226
Hopefully my video doesn't get removed,

28
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,239
I don't get charged money or anything,

29
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,513
and the speeds are faster than abyss.to.
