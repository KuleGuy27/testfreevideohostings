    1<br>
    00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,819<br>
    What’s up.<br>
    <br>
    2<br>
    00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:03,145<br>
    I’m gonna be using this as a test for uploading<br>
    <br>
    3<br>
    00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:07,079<br>
    and streaming video on 5 different free video hosting services.<br>
    <br>
    4<br>
    00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:08,542<br>
    When I first started this website,<br>
    <br>
    5<br>
    00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,872<br>
    I was thinking about how I would implement videos for my YouTube channels archive.<br>
    <br>
    6<br>
    00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:13,962<br>
    Now for me,<br>
    <br>
    7<br>
    00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:15,332<br>
    the answer was pretty simple.<br>
    <br>
    8<br>
    00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,185<br>
    A few years ago,<br>
    <br>
    9<br>
    00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:19,380<br>
    I stumbled upon a service called Abyss.to<br>
    <br>
    10<br>
    00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:22,460<br>
    and I found it on a Vietnamese anime dub piracy website<br>
    <br>
    11<br>
    00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,040<br>
    because I wanted to watch One Piece in Vietnamese dub.<br>
    <br>
    12<br>
    00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:29,283<br>
    The One Piece!<br>
    <br>
    13<br>
    00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,585<br>
    Truly always exist!<br>
    <br>
    14<br>
    00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:38,576<br>
    Abyss is a free video hoster with unlimited bandwidth and storage<br>
    <br>
    15<br>
    00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:42,354<br>
    and I've been using it since 2023 for another website<br>
    <br>
    16<br>
    00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:44,354<br>
    and the creation of this website here.<br>
    <br>
    17<br>
    00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:47,511<br>
    Abyss.to is great but my main problem with it<br>
    <br>
    18<br>
    00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,957<br>
    is the slow speeds that I've been getting.<br>
    <br>
    19<br>
    00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:51,823<br>
    It’s a total dealbreaker and even more<br>
    <br>
    20<br>
    00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:54,897<br>
    if you don’t have an adblock to block all the ads.<br>
    <br>
    21<br>
    00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:55,910<br>
    So because of this,<br>
    <br>
    22<br>
    00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,731<br>
    I went out of my way to “research” alternatives using AI LLMs<br>
    <br>
    23<br>
    00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,489<br>
    and these are the ones that I’ve found.<br>
    <br>
    24<br>
    00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:03,634<br>
    All 5 of them.<br>
    <br>
    25<br>
    00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,900<br>
    I have never used these services before,<br>
    <br>
    26<br>
    00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,213<br>
    so I am using this video as an opportunity to test and see if they work or not.<br>
    <br>
    27<br>
    00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:13,226<br>
    Hopefully my video doesn't get removed,<br>
    <br>
    28<br>
    00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,239<br>
    I don't get charged money or anything,<br>
    <br>
    29<br>
    00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,513<br>
    and the speeds are faster than abyss.to.<br>
